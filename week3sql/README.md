# Overview
The purpose of devoloping this software is that I currently use a CRM "customer relationship manager" and it is really nothing more than a SQL database. I wanted to see if I could write a program developing this. If I can write this and make it work with a web page I will be able to cancel the one I currently pay for.

# Relational Database

I created a customer realtionship manager. It manages clinets, their spouses, if they have a lender, the houses they are interested in. 

The tables have complex relationships to them. Some of them are a one to one relationship and others are a one to many and a few are many to many. 

# Development Environment

I used MYSQL and then pushed the code to VSC using an extension. 

I used MYSQL as well as VSC and the MYSQL tools extension to allow for intergration between the 2 software program.
